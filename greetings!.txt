Greetings unk1911,

My name is efraim - I am a general partner and VC at techgrind incubator and venture capital in Thailand.
One of our incubated companies is looking for a CTO and co-founder and has seen your speech engine work so the CEO is very interested in talking to you.
He is building something quite interesting which fits directly in line with what you have built here in your text-to-speech engine.
You can check out his page with a demo of his algorithm at: www.komponant.com

We are his investors and advisors - and believe this company has a $bn potential (we have built $bn tech companies before, so we should know).

It would be great if you contacted him and/or us with any questions if you are interested. The company is already well supported and it is in seed/early stage so you'd be able to join at the beginning as a founder.

I'm also an engineer, and aside from being an investor now as well I can tell you that our purpose in life is to be tech entrepreneurs.
It is how we can achieve and solve and build the most useful products for the world.

Please consider and get back to us.
Rodolphe - CEO Komponant - rodolphe@komponant.com
Efraim - CTO / GP TechGrind - th.efraim@techgrind.asia

Thank you and have a nice day! :)
